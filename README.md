This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# NextJS

- React Framework
- For building Web applications
- Full-stack framework
- Opinionated framework

## Features

- UI Building
- Rendering
  - Server side rendering (SSR)
  - Client side rendering (CSR)
  - Static site generation (SSG)
- Optimization
- Routing - File based routing
- API routes
- Data fetching
- Styling

## Component types

- Server component (By default)
- Client component

1. Server component: Server side tasks like data fetching, file read, database data fetching, async tasks

2. Client component: Exactly react component, hooks, events, user interaction

## NextJS Routing

- File/folder based routing
- All routes must be inside the `/app` directory
- Every route must have `page.js` or `page.tsx` file
- `page.js`/`page.tsx` file must have a default export component

1. Simple route

- Create a folder inside `/app` directory
- Create a `page.js` file inside this folder.
- Add a default export component

2. Nested route

- `/courses/frontend/react`
- `/courses/frontend/vue`
- `/courses/backend/laravel`
- `/courses/backend/node-express`

3. Dynamic route

- Create a folder enclosed by [] -> `/products/[id]`
- Route: `/products/:id`

4. Nested dynamic route

- Route: `/products/:id/reviews/:reviewId`
- Folder structure: `/products/[id]/reviews/[reviewId]`

5. Catch all segments

- `/news/general/political/congress`
- `/news/general/education/universities/tu/ioe/bct`
- `/news/general/education/board/see`
- `/news/weather`
- `/news/sports/football/men`
- `/news/sports/tennis/women`
- `/news/sports/cricket/t20/men`
- Folder structure: `/news/[...slug]`

6. Route groups

- Route: `/login`, `/register`
- But it should be inside `/auth` folder
- Name the `/auth` folder as `(auth)`

7. Private folders

- `/_<folder_name>` -> `/_components`

8. Not found route/page

- `app/not-found.js`

## NextJS files

**Note: The file names listed below should be exactly the same.**

- page.js (Routing)
- not-found.js (Not found page)
- layout.js / layout.tsx
- loading.js
- error.js

### Nested layout

- Use layout inside a route

## params and searchParams

- params: dynamic route parameter (id), page.js & layout.js
- searchParams: query parameter (?q=test), available only on page.js

## Metadata

- Metadata api is used to define metadata of page
- Can be used in page.js/layout.js
- Useful for SEO
- Static: metadata
- Dynamic: generateMetadata

## Auth

Credentials -> Login -> token (API) -> Store locally in browser (local storage)
If token -> User is logged in -> Use this token in API request
Else -> User is not logged in

### Storage

1. Local storage
  - Size: 5MB
  - Available only on browser
  - Data is stored forever

2. Session storage
  - Size: 5MB
  - Available only on browser
  - Data is cleared on tab close

3. Cookie storage
  - Size: 4KB
  - Available on browser & server
  - Data is stored permanently, with expiry date

- Hypertext transfer protocol

- GET: Fetch data (Read)
- POST: Create data (Create)
- PUT: Update data (Update)
- DELETE: Delete data (Delete)
- PATCH: Partial update
